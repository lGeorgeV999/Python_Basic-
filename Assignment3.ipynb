    "Functions are advantageous to have in programs for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: Functions allow us to break down our programs into smaller, more manageable chunks of code. This makes our code easier to read, understand, and maintain. We can write a function once and use it in multiple places throughout our program, reducing code duplication and promoting code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Functions allow us to hide complex logic and implementation details behind a simple interface. This makes it easier to use the function, since we don't need to understand how it works internally to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing: Functions make it easier to test our code. By breaking our program down into smaller functions, we can test each function individually and ensure that it works as expected. This makes it easier to identify and fix bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging: Functions make it easier to debug our code. By breaking our program down into smaller functions, we can isolate and fix errors more quickly and easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability: Functions make our code more readable and easier to understand. By giving descriptive names to functions, we can make our code self-documenting, which makes it easier for other developers to understand our code."
